    <h2>PWA Architecture</h2>
    <p>To explain, the CERN article writes, “This outlined the principal concepts, and it defined important terms behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called "World Wide Web" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by browsers” (CERN 2025). It supported basic HTML and could serve basic web pages over the HTTP protocol. The Apache Software Foundation published the Apache HTTP Server as an open-source project in 1995. Thanks to its larger open-source community, it swiftly rose to the top of the web server rankings. </p>
<p> For about 20 years, Apache dominated the web server market and was essential to the early development of the internet. In order to address the "C10K problem"—the challenge of managing 10,000 connections at once—Igor Sysoev invented Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") in 2004. Nginx’s architecture, in contrast to Apache's model, allowed for much superior performance and scalability, particularly for static data and reverse tunneling. In many large-scale deployments, Nginx started to compete with Apache by 2010 and finally overtook it in terms of popularity.Web servers utilize HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. There have been many studies about the speed increase of using HTTP/3. For example, Perna writes, “ We find that websites using HTTP/3 often host most web page objects on third-party servers that only support HTTP/2 or even HTTP/1.1. Websites that load objects from a limited number of third-party domains are the ones that see larger performance gains”(Perna, Computer Communications Vol 187, 2022). These iterations enhance security and performance. Configuration files are used by web servers to specify SSL certificates, virtual hosts, URL routing rules, and access controls. For improved performance and dynamic content, web servers can interface with application servers.</p>
