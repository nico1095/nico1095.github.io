    <h2>Importance of Web Servers</h2>
    <p>The actual physical computer hardware and software which is the program that decodes requests and provides files can both be referred to as web servers. Although web servers can be used for a variety of purposes, efficiency is the primary reason. Request Handling is another example of how web servers reply with the required resource after receiving HTTP/HTTPS client requests, which are used a lot in browsers.         In terms of worldwide web servers and internet speeds. Web servers and high-speed internet are directly related to developments in edge technology, cloud computing, and worldwide connectivity. Web servers are changing to satisfy the increasing needs for speed, scalability, and low-latency performance as internet connection becomes more prevalent and faster.
It is expected that even the most remote areas would have dependable broadband connectivity thanks to high-speed internet, particularly s like fiber, 4G and 5G. </p>
 <p>         Modern web servers have needed to adapt to the new marketplace of cloud computing also. When combined with cloud computing, modern web servers offer large scale, dependable, and efficient means of delivering web applications and information. Web servers used to run on actual computers, but thanks to cloud computing, they now run in virtualized settings spread around several data centers. Web servers can be deployed on virtual machines or serverless architectures by enterprises using cloud platforms such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services. The cloud-based web server receives an HTTP request from the user's browser when they visit a website. In order to process this request, the server runs application logic, retrieves content, queries a database, and returns the relevant answer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Content Delivery is when they provide either dynamic content produced by server-side scripts or static content (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pictures). </li>
      <li>IP addresses and domain names are used to identify web servers. </li>
      <li>Web servers are in charge of hosting and keeping website files while enabling speedy client access to any information.</li>
      <li>          The first web server was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989-1990, and it ran on the NeXT computer called CERN HTTPd.  </li>
