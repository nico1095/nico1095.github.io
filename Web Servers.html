    <h2>Importance of Web Servers</h2>
    <p>The actual physical computer hardware and software which is the program that decodes requests and provides files can both be referred to as web servers. Although web servers can be used for a variety of purposes, efficiency is the primary reason. Request Handling is another example of how web servers reply with the required resource after receiving HTTP/HTTPS client requests, which are used a lot in browsers.Web servers utilize HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. There have been many studies about the speed increase of using HTTP/3. </p>
